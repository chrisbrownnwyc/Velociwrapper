0.1.4

0.1.5
	- Calls to _create_search_params() create the native parameters to send to
	  elastic search and then remove the settings from the object. This allows
	  the collection object to be used for a new search. The drawback is
	  subsequent calls to all() will not work as expected.
	- added functionality for one() to return the first result of a query
