0.1.4
	- Fixed deepcopy of shared resources (specifically self._es)

0.2.0
	- Calls to _create_search_params() create the native parameters to send to
	  elastic search and then remove the settings from the object. This allows
	  the collection object to be used for a new search. The drawback is
	  subsequent calls to all() will not work as expected.
	- added functionality for one() to return the first result of a query
	- Raises AttributeError if an attribute doesn't exist (previously returned
	  None but we have now considered this a bug)
	- Fixed bugs related to _set_by_query not being set
	- Fixed _deleted not getting set
